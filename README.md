# Emotion-recognition-system
My PhD thesis. Our aim was to design an emotion recognition systems to recognize music-induced emotions by using forehead biosignals (facial expression+frontal EEG) and changes in heart rate (HR). The project had the following phases:
1) A pilot study to select musical stimuli for four emotional classes in Arousalâ€“Valence plane.
2) Signal acquisition during listening to the music excerpts. 
3) Feature extraction from forehead biosignals and HR time, optimum feature subset selection (using a fuzzy method and sequential forward floating selection).
4) Designing emotion recognition systems using neural networks and support vector machines (SVM), by applying information fusion methods in feature and decision levels. 
We introduced a new information fusion method for our specific purpose (appeared as novel3 in the repository; for more info pleae reafer to http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6864340/)
